# ABOUT ME
I’m **Nguyễn Công Thành**, a Vietnamese native, or in the American style, **Thanh Cong Nguyen**. My first name, **Thành**, is pronounced like “thank” without the “k” and can imply “success” in Vietnamese. What’s intriguing is that in the US format, my name becomes Thanh Cong, which together translates to “successful” in my native language.

I'm an incoming Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, starting Fall 2025. 

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Fulbright University Vietnam, where I was fortunate to work under the guidance of Prof. [Linh Tran](https://fulbright.edu.vn/our-team/tran-vinh-linh-2/) (Fulbright University Vietnam) and Prof. [Hoi Nguyen](https://math.osu.edu/people/nguyen.1261) (Ohio State University).

Previously, I've actively engaged with Mathematical Olympiads as both a competitor and a coach. 

I’m fascinated by a wide range of (non-academic) interests—music, arts, architecture, history, cars, cuisine, soccer, and more. But I haven’t yet found that one thing that sets my soul on fire, the kind of passion that makes me jump out of bed, buzzing with excitement to dive into it. I’m on a journey to discover what might ignite that spark.

# ABOUT THIS WEBSITE
This website is my digital notebook, a space to capture the random moments of my life. I also want this to be a place where I can reflect on the things that matter to me. My hope is to keep it real and not let it become a purely academic showcase, though I suspect my Ph.D. life will sneak in here and there over the next five years.

The site is built on a wonderful template by [Hyduf](https://github.com/hynduf), which I’ve customized with the invaluable help of my friend [Lanphgphm](https://github.com/lanphgphm). A huge thank you to both for making this space possible!
