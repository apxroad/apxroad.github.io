# ABOUT ME
I’m Nguyễn Công Thành, a Vietnamese native, or in the American style, Thanh Cong Nguyen. My first name, Thanh, is pronounced like "thank" without the "k" and carries the meaning "successful" in Vietnamese. What’s fascinating is that in the US format, my name becomes Thanh Cong, literally translating to "successful" in my native language.
