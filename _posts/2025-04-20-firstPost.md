So, this is my first blog, written right after I completed the most basic setup for it with the help of [Lanphgphm](https://lanphgphm.github.io/). 
At this point, I haven’t changed the background for the website yet; it’s still taken from the template of [Hyduf](https://github.com/hynduf). Choosing an appropriate background isn’t a basic task. It takes a lot of time to find the right one. And you don’t rush art. So, I decided to do it later—when the artist feels that creative spark, lol!

I’m writing this blog in this state of the website because Lanphgphm pressured me to write. So, I’m writing.

I’ve always wanted to create a website and write random stuff on it. But I never did. Of course, I’m too lazy to code the web. The creation of this website today is actually because, out of nowhere, Lanphgphm did almost everything, threw it in my face, and told me to set it up. So, I had no choice but to do it, haha. But the main reason for my procrastination is… Interestingly, I just can’t explain it.

It’s not just about writing blogs. I have many things I want to do, much more than writing blogs, and I’ve never done them. I just can’t say exactly why.

Maybe in the past, I didn’t have the conditions to do them. And so, even later, when I had the ability to try, I was just too used to ignoring my desires that I didn’t realize I could do them now. And maybe I’m just too busy doing things I believe I should do.

I forgot to live.

Maybe it’s time to start changing that now. I still have a lot of things to prioritize. But luckily, I think I have a small freedom that’s big enough to do what I want now. Lately, Lanphgphm’s boyfriend, a really great guy actually, said to me: *“Do what you have to do, then do what you want to do,”* when he talked about his situation. He looked so happy, finally able to do things that make him happy after two years. That was a really touching moment for me. I was like, oh, maybe I’m like that too. It’s time.

So, I guess that’s it, my first blog. I never imagined it would be like this. But it’s great. The content is natural and spontaneous, exactly what I want for my blog. I hope I can maintain it, lol. I mean, both the blog style and the “time” I mentioned.
